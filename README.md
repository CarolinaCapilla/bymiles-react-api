# By Bits Code Challenge

The purpose of this repository is to meet the criteria of the By Bits Coding Challenge. <br>
This criteria being:
  - Build a simple web application with 2 pages. Use the two Policy API endpoints provided. 
  - POST and GET data to the API. This data will be then used to authorised the user's login and to display the details of a car policy.
  - First page is a login screen which takes a username and a password.
  - Second page is a simple card which will display the details of a car policy fetched from the Policy details API endpoint.
  - The login has to be authorised with a token.
  - We make a POST request to the Login API endpoint with the username, password and type. We receive a response an store the access_token to then authorise the user's login.
  - Once authorised, we will redirect the user to the second page.
